   <h4>Danial Khan</h4>
   <p>Ever since I was a child I have been fascinated by the ephemeral nature of relationships of the elderly and how we can live longer together.
    My previous job was to help old people with things like nursing and care, food and medicine. I learned alot from working there, and I could see the different things that needed to be such as this product in order to make their daily lives easier.  I want to assist them by working in this project with all I have to offer. </p>

   <p>I am very open minded and believe that there are no limits to our imagination. My creativity flows through my veins every time I work on something that I love and have a burning passion for. This of course- reflects our products that I participated with. 

 

    Often when there is a problem, I will always find a new way to solve it. As a teen still, I feel like there's a lot of potential left for me to shine even brighter. I always tell myself to work hard constantly, but that doesn't mean we can take it easy from time to time. 
    
     
    
    I always find new challenges inspiring, it will help me improve and accomplish greater goals in the future, as a team or alone.  </p>

   <h6>Alan Blanco Alquezar</h6>
   <p>Study philosophy: 

    When faced with challenges inside and outside of my comfort zone I will tackle them and try to reach the limit of my potential.I will try my best and be kind to myself when it comes to accepting the results that I achieve, whether I find them disappointing. 
    
    <br><br> 
    
    Relationships philosophy: 
    
    I will strive to maintain healthy boundaries. I will try to apply introspection regularly to measure where I can improve when dealing with other people. I will not manipulate nor knowingly step on other peopleâ€™s boundaries, and I will not give in to being stepped over my own boundaries. I will apply communication and epistemology to solve conflicts. 
    
     
    
    Inner philosophy: 
    
    Every day I will apply the principles of gratitude and appreciation of the beauty of the things around me. I will find my balance in the worst of situations. I will apply fairness whenever it is within my reach, and I will be kind and bring humour to those around me in order to strengthen social connections.  </p>

   <h3>Martin Tran</h3>

    <p>My work explores the relationship between the challenges of ageing and midlife mindfulness at the intersection of achievement. With both personal experience and influences as diverse as a father and a grandfather, new synergies are synthesised from both personal and external experiences. 

      Ever since I was a teenager I have been fascinated by the essential unreality of the human condition. What starts out as triumph soon becomes finessed into a spaghetti of daily lifestyle challenges, the stubbornness of ageing, leaving only a sense of failing and the possibility of a new synthesis. 
      
      As subtle achievements become unravelled through diligent and repetitive practice, the end user is left with a tribute to the outposts of our existence. </p>
